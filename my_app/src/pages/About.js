    Cocktails can be categorized into several types, including classic cocktails, which are timeless recipes like the Martini, Old Fashioned, and Margarita. Modern cocktails are innovative creations that often use unique ingredients and techniques, such as molecular gastronomy. Tropical cocktails are typically fruity and refreshing, including popular drinks like Pi√±a Colada and Mai Tai. Additionally, there are non-alcoholic cocktails (or mocktails), which contain no alcohol and use juices, soda, herbs, and spices to create flavorful alternatives.The ingredients in cocktails generally consist of spirits, which are base liquors such as vodka, gin, rum, tequila, whiskey, and brandy. Liqueurs are sweetened spirits with various flavors, like Triple Sec, Amaretto, or Campari, that add complexity to cocktails. Mixers are non-alcoholic components that add flavor and volume, such as tonic water, soda, juices, or syrups. Garnishes like fruits, herbs, or spices enhance both the presentation and flavor of cocktails, with examples including lemon twists, olives, or mint leaves.There are several common techniques used in cocktail preparation. Shaking involves mixing ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker to chill and dilute the drink. Stirring gently combines ingredients in a glass to chill them without excessive dilution. Muddling is the process of pressing herbs or fruits to release their flavors before adding other ingredients. Finally, layering refers to the careful pouring of ingredients to create distinct layers within the glass.
